'''
In this exercise we will write a function to extract all of the binding sites
for a given factor from chenTF.txt

The easiest way to complete this exercise is to make edits and try running the entire file
in canopy by selecting run from the menu bar

    fill in the rest of the code
    tfSites should be a list of binding sites for the given factor

#Test your function by using it to open up chenTF.txt
#And print the value of the second row first column

oct4Sites = getTFSites(chenFileName,'Oct4')

print(oct4Sites)





#BONUS
#This code is not very fool proof
#For instance try uncommenting and running it with the following lines

#oct4Sites = getTFSites(chenFileName, 'oct4')

#lmycSites = getTFSites(chenFileName,'l-myc')

#Can you fix up the getTFSites function to still give you oct4 sites in the first instance
#And to print an error message like "ERROR: THIS TF IS NOT IN THE DATA SET"
#In the second instance?
